	description = When it became apparent that light could be emitted from electrical systems without using an electric motor to generate friction in carefully constructed emitters, spotlight sizes could be reduced dramatically.  The new high intensity discharge bulbs are a spin off of Xenon based ION drives, projecting visible light photons instead of trickles of xenon.  You can even point them forwards without slowing youself down.  Although the same could be said of many ION drives.
