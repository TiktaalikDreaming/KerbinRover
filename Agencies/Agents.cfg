  description = The quitisentially Brikish Land Rover company began as a manufacturer of just the Defender, which was just known as the Land Rover at the time.  Since then their focus has moved around, but has always involved off-road-vehicles, and alway had space for the dedicated off-road Defender.  The '88 purchase by Brikish Aerospace led to development of a space capable Defender as an advertizing gimick.
